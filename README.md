# Coding Adventures from a noob

I thoroughly enjoy playing Arkham Horror the card game, so when trying to introduce some friends into the game, I thought to myself: what's the best way for them to pick their first investigators?
Hence, this 1 day coding quiz came about.

I don't know where this will lead me. :)
